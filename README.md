### Myself
 Hi everyone! let me introduce myself. I am Riya Thakur currently pursuing B.Tech in Electronics and Communications at **Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College, Ludhiana**. I completed my 10th and 12th grades at **Spring Dale Public School, Ludhiana** achieving 84.4% and 80.8%. We have come to a new phase of our life where our new journey begings, everyone is  finding their own path and working hard for their goals. Lets just all work hard hoping to see our future self as an successful person.  

### Why I choosed B.Tech?
I choosed B.Tech because I was always interested in 'How things work?'. I developed my interest more in 8th grade when my computer teacher taught us HTML. It was something new that developed my interest. B.Tech emphasize innovation and creativity, encouraging students to develop new technologies. It also have many career options.

Everyone likes to learn new skills. Even I also wanted to learn . I was interested in knowing how things work, how coding is done and many more.This lead to my dream of becoming an engineer.

### First day at College
I first attendend my college at July 10, 2024, where my new journey began. The day was started by the kirtan at Gurudwara Sahib at the campus. Guru Saheb blessed us with his blessings. later on we are off to auditorium where we were given our college brochures. **Principal Dr.Sehijpal Singh** addresses the students and welcomed us. they told us about rules and regulations. **Mr.Jeevandeep Singh** addresses the students and told us about "_How to increase our attention span?_" , "_How to manage our college days?_". Sir told us to avoid videos lasting 30 sec to 1 min and suggested us to watch videos lasting 15 mins to 30 mins, as it will improve our attention span and we will be focused during our work. Sir wonderfully explained us about these points. Later on **Mr.Rajeshwar Singh Sidhu** guided us. Sir explained us about his journey and how to achieve our goal. Sir explained everything in detail. **Dr.Surinderveer Singh** also graced the occasion.

It was an honour to listen to these great personalities. The whole Induction Program was organised by our seniors. It was organised for us to get to know about our college and facilities the college have etc. The program is upto July 9th to July 27th . The session will be started from JuLy 29, 2024. I am very excited to attend the induction program and learn new skills. Looking forward to my new journey.
