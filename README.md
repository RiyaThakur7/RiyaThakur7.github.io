>It might be a bittersweet path but the fruit will taste sweet.

### Myself
 Hi everyone! let me introduce myself. I am Riya Thakur currently pursuing B.Tech in Electronics and Communications at **Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College, Ludhiana**. I completed my 10th and 12th grades at **Spring Dale Public School, Ludhiana** achieving 84.4% and 80.8%. We have come to a new phase of our life where our new journey begings, everyone is  finding their own path and working hard for their goals. Lets just all work hard hoping to see our future self as an successful person.  

### Why I choosed B.Tech?
I choosed B.Tech because I was always interested in 'How things work?'. I developed my interest more in 8th grade when my computer teacher taught us HTML. It was something new that developed my interest. B.Tech emphasize innovation and creativity, encouraging students to develop new technologies. It also have many career options.

#### Hobbies
1. Drawing (even though I'am not an expert)
2. Listening to music
  * Well I listen to many types of genres
3. Travelling
Everyone likes to learn new skills. Even I also wanted to learn . I was interested in knowing how things work, how coding is done and many more (Even I break my toys to know how they work< even though I was not able to fix them) This lead to my dream of becoming an engineer.

### First day at College
I first attendend my college at July 10,2024 ,whwere my new journey began. The day was started by the kirtan at Gurudwara Sahib at the campus. Guru Saheb blessed us with his blessings. later on we are off to auditorium where we were given our college brochures. **Principal Mr.Sehijpal Singh** sir  addresses the students and welcomed us. they told us about rules and regulations. **Mr.Jeevandeep Singh** sir addresses the students and told us about "_How to increase our attention span?_" , "_How to manage our college days?_". Sir wonderfully explained us about these points. Later on **Mr.Rajeshwar Singh Sidhu** Sir guided us .Sir explained us about his journey and how to achieve our goal. Sir explained everything in detail. **Dr.Surinderveer Singh** sir also graced the occasion.
